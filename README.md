# Reshape
Dynamic web content modification for special needs

Use Human-Computer Interaction to build computer suite that can help all differently abled people to have equal access to all online activities.

We want to understand the user and know his/her needs to support him as efficiently as we can.

Our tool works as an in-browser plugin.

We made some tests/games to make the user click, drag, point, and scroll to collect data related to his/her interacting with a general website.

Using these features, we created a voice assistant which will handle simple commands like search/click/enlarge on a particular website to makes adjustments to the DOM for better accesibility.
